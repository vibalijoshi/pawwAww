# pawwAww

I made an electron-vue app that showcases the 'awwwest' sub r/aww, and also I felt the need to make a desktop app for Reddit (in dark mode ofcourse)

## Technology used
- [Vue CLI Plugin Electron Builder](https://nklayman.github.io/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder/)
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for the UI
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-axios) for fetching data from [r/aww](https://reddit.com/r/aww.json)

It was really fun learning to build a desktop app (which included cutest animals!)
